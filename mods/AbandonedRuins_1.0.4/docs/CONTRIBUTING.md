## Contributing ruins

You are invited to contribute ruins to the mod. You can use the dedicated [ruin maker mod](https://github.com/Bilka2/ruin-maker) to easily create ruins in-game. You can also manually create or edit ruins, their format is documented here: [Ruin data format](../docs/format.md).

If you know your way around Lua, please make a pull request that includes the ruin files and requires them in the Lua files in /ruins. Otherwise, you can zip the generated files and attach them to a [new GitHub issue](https://github.com/Bilka2/AbandonedRuins/issues/new) to submit them as an addition to this mod.
