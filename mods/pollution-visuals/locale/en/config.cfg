show-pollution-visuals=turn on or off the smog visual effects
layers-pollution-visuals=this is the maximum number of layers a smog cloud wil render ontop of one another. you can see this as the maximum thickness that a smog cloud wil have
base-pollution-visuals= the thickness of a smog cloud is calculated with this equation. (a*b^x + offset). this option changes the "b" parameter. you can plug in the number you desire in an online graphic calculator like desmos to visualise your desired parameters on a graph
y-intercept-pollution-visuals= the thickness of a smog cloud is calculated with this equation. (a*b^x + offset). this option changes the "a" parameter. you can plug in the number you desire in an online graphic calculator like desmos to visualise your desired parameters on a graph
x-offset-pollution-visuals= the thickness of a smog cloud is calculated with this equation. (a*b^x + offset). this option changes thew "offset" parameter. you can plug in the number you desire in an online graphic calculator like desmos to visualise your desired parameters on a graph
chunks-per-tick-pollution-visuals = the number of chunks that will be checked every tick. the lower the value the more preformant
