Version: 1.1.30
Date: 28. 07. 2021
  Features:
    - Implemented a ground water pumpjack with relative tech, ground water pumpjacks are land based pumps (Offshore pumps will still be the real deal though)
        - If bob's mining is installed there will be 5 tiers of ground water pumpjacks
            - If Kirazy's "Artisanal Reskin" is installed ground water pumpjacks will have tiered sprites and icons
  Changes:
    - Bob's ground water patches are removed to keep up the balance (lithia water is NOT affected, only ground water is removed)
  Info:
    - Ground water pumpkjack will always require electricity regardless of the settings (price to pay for pumping wherever you like)
    - The new features balance are is not throughly tested with angel's mods, consider it an early version if you decide to give it a shot and report any issues
  Bugfixes:
    - Recipes requiring the vanilla offshore pump as ingredient will now use my version of it
