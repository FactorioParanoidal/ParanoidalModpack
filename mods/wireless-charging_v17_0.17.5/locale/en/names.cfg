wireless-charging-hi-power-induction-rail=Allows wireless charging of stationary train cars equipped with induction coils at a rate of up to 20 MW. Each rail segment can transmit to only one coil. (Also charges cars, or yourself, if you feel like standing on train tracks is a good idea.)
wireless-charging-hi-power-induction-station=Allows wireless charging of stationary vehicles or characters equipped with induction coils in close proximity at a rate of up to 20 MW. Each station can transmit to only one coil. Sends the vehicle's charge level to the circuit network.
wireless-charging-lo-power-induction-rail=Allows wireless charging of stationary train cars equipped with induction coils parked there at a rate of up to 500 kW. Each rail segment can transmit to only one coil. (Also charges cars, or yourself, if you feel like standing on train tracks is a good idea.)
wireless-charging-lo-power-induction-station=Allows wireless charging of stationary vehicles or characters equipped with induction coils in close proximity at a rate of up to 500 kW. Each station can transmit to only one coil. Sends the vehicle's charge level to the circuit network.
