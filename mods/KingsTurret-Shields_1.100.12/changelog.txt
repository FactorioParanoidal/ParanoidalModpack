---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.100.0
Date: 9/5/2020
  Changes:
    - Kingdud forks this mod from the original and updates this changelog to work in-game. Any updates prior to this one that reference 'me' are not referring to Kingdud.
    - Greatly simplify backend code. Completely remove on_tick function call.
    - Remove ability to toggle power usage on/off
    - Remove ability to change most settings during gameplay (they are startup variables now).
    - Shields now use the 'energy_drain' property instead of 'power_usage', for the power drain method; basically, moving the drain to the in-game variable specifically designed to act as a drain!
    - Shields now use the internal buffer of the electric interface as the shield bar, and the inflow rate as the recharge rate. This allowed for complete removal of code that was micro-managing these actions.
    - Shields now use raw damage, rather than post-resist damage. So if you are using a modded turret with high resists, you may notice your shields now taking a LOT more damage, because your shields now have 0 resists, whereas before they were piggy-backing the resists of your turret.
    - Overall shield design is meant to be a meaningful, but modest, power draw while idle, and massive spikes (into the GW range with 1000s of turrets) during combat.
    - Removed the "No-power Penalty" from the mod. This functionality is now emulated by the energy_drain change. You lose the ability to drain power at two different rates, which never made any sense anyway.
    - Mod now uses the technology max_level property to limit infinite research to levels the mod is designed for (100 levels).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.26

    - Better compatibility to other mods
    - Fix for research being unavailable, but it might show up if you have deactivated it. (No clue what mod is causing it, I have never experienced that issue.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.21
  Changes:
    - Added energy consumption
    - When idle, the shields draw power equal to 0.1% of their maximum hitpoints per second. If there's not enough power to satisfy this need, the shields will collapse quickly. The setting for the energy consumption multiplier can be found under "startup settings". Obviously recharging your whole base can hit your energy balance pretty hard. If you can't handle it, use the cheat "ts refresh"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.13
  Changes:
    - Optimized textures for low graphics settings
    - If you were researching one of the technologies before 0.16.12, the game won't display the current progress but is still researching (but it might have resetted the progress). you can check the progress by switching to another technology and switching back.
