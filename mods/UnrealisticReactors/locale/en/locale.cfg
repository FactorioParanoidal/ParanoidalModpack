RealisticReactors_Title=Congratulations! With this mod you have made your nuclear reactor setup a little bit more exciting!\n\nRealistic reactors [entity=realistic-reactor] produce heat and consume nuclear power cells just like the vanilla reactors. But their power output [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-power-output] and efficiency [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-efficiency] changes depending on the reactor core temperature [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-core-temp] and the reactor setup [virtual-signal=signal-neighbour-bonus].\nThe breeder reactor [entity=realistic-reactor-breeder] works similar to the normal reactor. It has a little less power output but produces additional empty fuel cells. This is useful if you need to produce specific products from empty fuel cells (like for example plutonium with GotLags Nuclear Fuel Mod - which I recommend using with this mod by the way...).\n\nBoth reactors require proper cooling. If their core reaches 1000° a nuclear meltdown will occur. To prevent this the reactors have an integrated ECCS (Emergency Core Cooling System), where you can insert cold water to cool the reactor core. Cooling towers [entity=rr-cooling-tower] are used to cool down the hot water.

RealisticReactors_Operate=Reactor control is done via signals. You have to send them to the [entity=realistic-reactor-interface], the interface also tells you all important data to your reactor:\n[virtual-signal=signal-state-stopped]\n[virtual-signal=signal-state-starting]\n[virtual-signal=signal-state-running]\n[virtual-signal=signal-state-scramed]\n[virtual-signal=signal-reactor-core-temp]\n[virtual-signal=signal-coolant-amount]\n[virtual-signal=signal-reactor-power-output]\n[virtual-signal=signal-reactor-efficiency]\n[virtual-signal=signal-neighbour-bonus]\n[virtual-signal=signal-reactor-cell-bonus]\n[virtual-signal=signal-reactor-electric-power]\n\nTo __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__start a reactor__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ you need to insert a fuel cell and send the [virtual-signal=signal-control-start] to the reactor. The reactor then enters its starting state, at which it will consume additional electric energy. \nAt the end of the starting phase it will enter the running state. Now you can see the power output and efficiency slowly changing depending on the core temperature.\n\nTo __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__stop a reactor__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ you can simply let it consume the inserted fuel cell. To force an emergency stop you need to send the [virtual-signal=signal-control-scram] to the circuit interface. The reactor will then enter the SCRAM state, in which it will continue to produce heat for a certain amount of time. Make sure the reactor is cooled until the end of the SCRAM phase!\n\nTo __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__cool the reactor__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ you can either use all of its produced heat with heat exchangers or cool it via the [entity=realistic-reactor-eccs]. \nPlease note that at the highest reactor output levels the ECCS alone is not able to cool down the core temperature anymore. That means you need to combine both cooling methods to be safe.\n\n__CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__Additional notes__CONTROL_STYLE_END__\n - A reactor needs to be connected to the electric network. It consumes electric power to do certain operations like signal output or ECCS cooling. It has an internal accumulator to store a certain amount of energy.\n - The reactor information can also be viewed in a GUI. Simply click on the circuit interface of a reactor to open the GUI. In the GUI you can also enable a graph which shows you the output over a time period.

RealisticReactors_Output=[virtual-signal=signal-reactor-power-output], [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-efficiency] and [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-cell-bonus] change dynamically depending on the reactor core temperature.\nThe general rule for power output and breeder bonus production is: the higher the temperature, the better. For the efficiency it's different: maximum efficiency is reached at a certain temperature, above and also below that point the efficiency is going to drop.\nEfficiency has a fixed minimum of 50%, and a fixed maximum of 200%.\n\nAll three values depend on the reactor setup, meaning the number of reactors connected by heat pipes (this feature replaces the vanilla neighbor bonus). The maximum is 4 connected reactors, the current state is visible in the [virtual-signal=signal-neighbour-bonus].\n\nThe following two pages show you the exact output values of the reactor and the breeder reactor. More information comes with the mod, it is stored in the mod archive under DOCUMENTATION. \n\n__CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__Spoiler alarm!__CONTROL_STYLE_END__\nIf you want to find out the outputs in-game (it's possible via the signals or the GUI), then don't look at this.   \n\nPlease note that all of this is only valid if you play in the standard mode __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__[Ingo's formulas]__CONTROL_STYLE_END__. You can change the mode in the settings if you prefer __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__[Ownlys Formulas]__CONTROL_STYLE_END__.

RealisticReactors_OutputReactor=The following table shows the power production at the point of maximum efficiency for the four setups, and following from the power production the number of heat exchangers and steam turbines (both rounded up),for which this setup can provide heat.\n\n[img=tab-r-1]\n[img=tab-r-2]\n[img=tab-r-3]\n[img=tab-r-4]\n[img=tab-r-5]\n *this is of course theoretical as the reactor explodes at 1000°

RealisticReactors_OutputBreeder=The following table shows the power production at the point of maximum efficiency for the four setups, and following from the power production the number of heat exchangers and steam turbines (both rounded up),for which this setup can provide heat.\n\n[img=tab-b-1]\n[img=tab-b-2]\n[img=tab-b-3]\n[img=tab-b-4]\n[img=tab-b-5]\n *this is of course theoretical as the reactor explodes at 1000°

RealisticReactors_Meltdown=When the reactor reaches 1000° its core will melt. This will cause the reactor to explode leaving behind a [entity=reactor-ruin]. The ruin will constantly produce radioactivity in form of a radioactive cloud, which will - depending on the wind - spread in the area around the ruin and leave radioactive fallout behind.   \nTo stop the radioactivity you need to build a [entity=reactor-sarcophagus] over the reactor ruin. After a long time (visible in its health) the sarcophagus can be removed.
