  "description": "Allows the player to configure any machine from the map, without allowing item transfer so it maintains the vanilla feel.\nAllows wire placement and entity copy/paste at any distance.\nPress R to issue a rotation request, right-click to mark for deconstruction.\n\nLess cheaty alternative to Far Reach. Similar to Space Exploration's Navigation Satellite, but works entirely within map view.",
