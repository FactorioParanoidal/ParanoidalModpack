[mod-setting-description]
research-causes-evolution-weighting=How to weight evolution effect of technologies. Default is to increase more early, and then taper off, like vanilla evolution. Equal means all technologies have the same effect. Late gives a gentle start to the game, with later technologies effecting evolution more.
research-causes-evolution-include-upgrades=Can (non-infinite) upgrade technologies contribute to evolution. Recommended for smoother evolution. The old behaviour of the mod was to ignore all upgrades.
