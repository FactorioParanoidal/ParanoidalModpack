[technology-description]
CW-air-filtering=Enables the crafting of Air Filter Machines to improve air quality reducing pollution. Air filter machines are power hungry but auto turn off if there's not enough pollution
CW-air-filter-cleaning=Used air filters can be reused after being cleaned and refilled with coal but you still have to deal with the captured polution
CW-methanol-production=Fisrt stage of liquid fuel production and several chemical processes
CW-polycarbonate-production=CO2 rich plastics production 
CW-carbon-mineralization=A bit expensive way to produce cement but a good way to imprision carbon dioxide
CW-gas-to-fluids=It's a expensive way to produce fuel but completely carbon neutral
