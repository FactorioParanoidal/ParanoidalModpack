Version: 0.17.6
Date: 27. 06. 2019
  Changes:
    - no longer uses the icon from bobplates, but it's own copy of it.
    - Steam assembling machine causes pollution. (the electric does, so I can't use "the pollution is generated by the boilers" as an excuse, as that effects electric too)
  Balancing:
    - Slight balance to steam assembling machine. (uses a little less power, 300kW instead of 400kW, or 60kW per tier instead of 80kW)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.5
Date: 23. 06. 2019
  Features:

    - Added a burner assembling machine with speed 0.25, 60kW and size 2x2
    - Added a steam powered assembling machine with pass through steam pipe. The entity is tuned to work best with top tier steam, this means it will scale in power based on steam tier. speed 0.4 and 80kW per tier (speed 2 and 400kW at maximum)
  Changes:
    - Updated graphics of Assembling machines to include HR versions (Except assembling machine 4 with updated colours turned off)
